# CROSSFIT WOD API
**WOD – Workout of the Day**

---

## Introduction
This is a mini project created to understand how APIs work in the backend using Node.js and Express.  
It demonstrates how different endpoints are organized through routers and how data is returned using controllers and services.  
The project also explains how a database connects with the frontend through API endpoints.  
This project idea was explained by the author Jean-Marc Möckel in a FreeCodeCamp blog.
